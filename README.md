# System.IO
Partial c++ header only implementation of .NET System.IO classes. Goal of this project is to have similar functionality from .NET System.IO available in c++. Currently (partial)implemented are:

* DirectoryInfo
* FileInfo
* FileSystemInfo
* Path

These sources contain the header files in the include directory and a set of tests to verify they are working correctly.
